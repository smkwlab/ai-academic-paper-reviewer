### Typical Workflow Integration
```yaml
# In student thesis repositories
name: "Academic Paper Review"
on:
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - 'thesis/**/*.tex'
      - 'thesis/**/*.md'

jobs:
  academic-review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Academic Paper Review Bot
        uses: toshi0806/ai-academic-paper-reviewer@v1
        with:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          GEMINI_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.GEMINI_API_KEY }}
          LANGUAGE: "Japanese"
          REVIEW_MODE: "ACADEMIC"
```
